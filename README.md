# Global CO2 Emissions Dashboard

---

## Overview
This interactive Tableau dashboard presents an in-depth analysis of global carbon dioxide (CO‚ÇÇ) emissions by country over time. It combines time-series, spatial, and relational visualizations to offer a multifaceted understanding of how different nations contribute to global emissions.

---

## Purpose
The dashboard is designed to:

- Visualize emission trends and population-emission relationships globally.

- Identify the top CO‚ÇÇ emitters and their geographic distribution.

- Enable data-driven exploration to support environmental insights and awareness.

---

## Data Preparation
Before visualization, the dataset underwent cleaning and formatting within Tableau:

- Removed null values to maintain data accuracy.

- Corrected misspelled or inconsistent country names that were causing records to become ‚Äúunidentified.‚Äù

- Ensured data formatting aligned with visualization requirements.

## Data Source
Source: Our World in Data ‚Äì CO‚ÇÇ and Greenhouse Gas Emissions

Coverage: Global, from 1750 to 2021

Granularity: Annual emissions data by country, measured in million tonnes (Mt)

---

## Key Visualizations
üìà Line Chart:
Shows CO‚ÇÇ emissions by the top 10 emittor country over time. This helps users compare how emissions have increased or decreased in the countries across decades.

üåç Map Visualization:
A filled map that highlights CO‚ÇÇ emissions by country. Color intensity represents the scale of emissions, providing a quick global overview.

üîò Scatter Plot:
Displays CO‚ÇÇ emissions vs. population per country, helping identify whether population size correlates with higher emissions.

## Dashboard Features
- Interactive filters for country

- Hover tooltips showing detailed metrics per point or region

- User-guided exploration through multiple visual perspectives

---

## Insights Users Can Explore
- Emission patterns over time for top 10 emitters

- Which countries emit more CO‚ÇÇ relative to their population

- Geographic disparities in carbon output

- Long-term emission trends of developing vs developed nations
